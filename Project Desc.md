My goal for my October IDP was to make a chatbot that told halloween jokes because I thought it would be a fun thing to do for October. I got the idea to do this idea because I had randomly stumbled upon a website with a lot of halloween jokes and wanted to do a project that incorporated them. 

I did some work in between these updates but they were my main milestones of the project:
1st update: I planned out how I wanted the end result to work in notes. 

2nd update: After watching some tutorials and figuring out how the end result could end up working, I drew a picture of what I wanted the screen to look like and finalized the details of what it would do including the jokes I wanted to use. 

3rd update: I started piecing together the code working in the index.html section for the first time and using conditionals. But the code kept appearing in the console section for a reason I could not figure out, so I decided to take a break to think about it. 

4th update: I figured out how to get the code to show up on the screen and I figured out the basics of the majority of the code and was able to make some more progress with the question button. It was now that I realized I wanted to use a seperate button for the answer but was unsure of how to do it without making the code too confusing. 

5th update: I got the second button working by creating a new function and started venturing into the style.css for the design of the screen. I chose purple as the background, orange for the button words, and black for the title. I also added the halloween emojis next to the title. I also added papyrus fonts to the words onn the screen. I tried to use the google font, creepster but could not figure it out. 

6th update: I figured out how to use the google font I wanted to use by adding the href link and added a border to the button and instructions. 

7th update: I added more jokes and clarified the instructions to make using it easier.

Note:
   It might seem like I should've made an erase button for the previous jokes for this project but I wanted the past jokes/attempts to be visible in terms of the look of the screen, so I chose not to focus on that. 

This Project taught me how to work some in the HTML section and the style.css section. I can confidently make a message to response code. If I had more time I would make opening the code a little smoother and (with even MORE time) I would try using the speech function in P5 where the computer talks instead of just writing the words. But overall, I got what I wanted to do and I made time to work on this project even on my busiest days.
